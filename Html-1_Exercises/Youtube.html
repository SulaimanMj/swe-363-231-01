    <p><strong>Youtube</strong> is a great source to find reviews for different devices, but not all of them are trusted, some of them are paid reviews, some of them are biased, and some of them are fake reviews.</p>
    <p>Here are some tips to use Youtube to inspect the device:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Check the number of views and likes, if the video has a lot of views and likes, then it is probably a trusted review.</li>
        <li>Check the comments, if the comments are positive, then it is probably a trusted review.</li>
        <li>Check the number of subscribers, if the channel has a lot of subscribers, then it is probably a trusted review.</li>
        <li>Check the number of videos, if the channel has a lot of videos, then it is probably a trusted review.</li>
        

    </ul>
